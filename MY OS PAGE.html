                <h3>Mainframe system</h3>
                
                <p>A mainframe is a large computer system designed to process very large amounts of data quickly. Mainframe systems are widely used in industries like the financial sector, airline reservations, logistics and other fields where a large number of transactions need.
                    EXAMPLE:         IBM zSeries, System z9 and System z10 servers
                    </p>
                    <h3>Batch systems </h3>
                    
                    <p>Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects the programs and data together in a batch before processing starts.
                        EXAMPLE:       Payroll System, Bank Statements etc.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Time Sharing System</h3>
                
                        <p>Time-sharing is a technique which enables many people, located at various terminals, to use a particular computer system at the same time.
                            EXAMPLE:     a mainframe computer that has many users logged on to it. Each user uses the resources of the mainframe -i.e. memory, CPU etc.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Multiprogramming system</h3>
                
                            <p>The technique of utilizing several programs concurrently in a single computer system via multiprocessing.
                                EXAMPLE:     A computer running excel and firefox browser simultaneously.
                                </p>

                <h3>Multi-tasking system</h3>
                
                <p>Multitasking, in an operating system, is allowing a user to perform more than one computer task at a time.
                    EXAMPLE:
                    ⦁		           Responding to emails while listening to a podcast.
                    ⦁			Taking notes during a lecture.
                    ⦁			Completing paperwork while reading the fine print.
                    ⦁			Driving a vehicle while talking to someone.
                    ⦁		             Talking on the phone while greeting someone. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Desktop operating system</h3>
                
                                <p>When referring to an operating system or GUI (graphical user interface), the desktop is a system of organization of icons on a screen.
                                    EXAMPLE:        Windows, Max OS, and various Linux distributions Ubuntu, Linux Mint, CentOS, Debian. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3> Multiprocessor system</h3>
                
                                    <p>A Multiprocessor is a computer system with two or more central processing units (CPUs) share full access to a common RAM. There are two types of multiprocessors, one is called shared memory multiprocessor and another is distributed memory multiprocessor.
                                        EXAMPLE:	Windows NT 2000, XP, and Unix.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Distributed Systems</h3>
                
                                        <p>A distributed system is a system in which components are located on different networked computers, which can communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. 
                                            EXAMPLE:	Intranets, Internet, WWW, email, Telecommunication networks Telephone networks and Cellular networks.
                                            </p>

                <h3>Client–server system</h3>
                
                <p>The client-server model describes how a server provides resources and services to one or more clients.
                    EXAMPLE:	client-server:
                                 web servers, mail servers, and file servers.
                            client-devices:
                                desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Peer-to-peer system</h3>
                    
                    <p>A P2P network, the "peers" are computer systems which are connected to each other via the Internet. Files can be shared directly between systems on the network without the need of a central server.
                        EXAMPLE:	Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Manjaro. In Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.
                        </p>
                        <h3>clustered systems</h3>
                        
                        <p>The clustered systems are a combination of hardware clusters and software clusters. The hardware clusters help in sharing of high performance disks between the systems. The software clusters makes all the systems work together.
                            EXAMPLE:	IBM General Parallel File System, Microsoft's Cluster Shared Volumes or the Oracle Cluster File System.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Real-time system</h3>
                            
                            <p>A real-time system is a time-bound system which has well-defined, fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail. 
                                EXAMPLE:	Air Traffic Control Systems, Networked Multimedia Systems, Command Control Systems etc.
